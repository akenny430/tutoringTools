# Prime Number Tester

A very simple program that can test whether or not given numbers are prime. 
The user simply types in numbers separated by a space, 
and for each number inputed the program will tell you whether or not it is prime. 

I chose to use the [Miller-Rabin primality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerâ€“Rabin_primality_test)
for this program.  
All of the pseudocode of the algorithms was taken from 
Chapter 31, Section 8 of 
[Introduction to Algorthms (by Cormen et al.)](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844), 
and implemented in C.
