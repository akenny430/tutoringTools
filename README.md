# Tutoring Tools 

A repo of several programs written to help with mathematics tutoring. 
The purpose of creating these tools from scratch are two-fold: 

1. They are written to be run quickly and easily from the command line. 

2. It's fun to write something from scratch to understand how it works. 


## Prime Number Tester

Tests  whether or not given numbers are prime. 
The user simply types in numbers separated by a space, 
and for each number inputed the program will tell you whether or not it is prime. 

The [Miller-Rabin primality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerâ€“Rabin_primality_test) is used 
for this program.  
All of the pseudocode of the algorithms was taken from 
Chapter 31, Section 8 of 
[Introduction to Algorthms (by Cormen et al.)](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844), 
and implemented in C.
